# Tasks Checklist

List of things to try out before releasing this library

- [ ] See how to deal with optional fields in `mkSmartObject`
- [ ] Have a simple way to handle plain types in `mkSmartObject`
      (they should use `e.right` as the smart constructor by default)
- [ ] Setup documentation generation
